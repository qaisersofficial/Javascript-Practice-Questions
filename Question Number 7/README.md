## Counting Pattern Generator
==========================

This JavaScript program generates a pattern of number <code> (`1 to 5`)</code> and prints it to the console. The pattern consists of 5 rows.

## Output
1<br>
12<br>
123<br>
1234<br>
12345<br>
## **How it works:**

The program uses two nested `for` loops to generate the pattern. The outer loop iterates 5 times, generating each row of the pattern. The inner loop generates each number (`1 to 5 `) in the current row. The resulting pattern is printed to the console.

## **Run it:**

 Simply copy and paste the code into a JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or a Node.js runtime, and run it to see the pattern in action!
