<h1>Question Number:11</h1>
<p>Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.

  The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
  
  Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</p>
