# Even Numbers from 1 to 20
==============================

A simple JavaScript program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 20.

## About the Program
------------------

This program uses a basic `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 20 and checks each number to see if it's even. If the number is even, it's added to a string that's then displayed on the page.

## How it Works

The program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is even. If the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0, the number is even.
