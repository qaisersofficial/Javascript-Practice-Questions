## Asterisk Pattern Generator
==========================

This JavaScript program generates a pattern of asterisks <code> (`*`)</code> and prints it to the console. The pattern consists of 5 rows, with each row containing an increasing number of asterisks.

## Output
*<br>
**<br>
***<br>
****<br>
*****<br>
## **How it works:**

The program uses two nested `for` loops to generate the pattern. The outer loop iterates 5 times, generating each row of the pattern. The inner loop generates each asterisk (`*`) in the current row. The resulting pattern is printed to the console.
